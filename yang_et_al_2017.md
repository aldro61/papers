Antibiotic efficacy -- context matters

* The primary targets and mechanisms of action for most bactericidal antibiotics have been identified and well-studied [1]; however, there is a growing appreciation that antibiotic lethality is a complex systems-level process that is sensitive to environmental factors.

* In light of the diminishing pipeline for antibiotic discovery [3], there is an urgent need to better understand mechanisms and factors that influence antibiotic efficacy.

* We discuss how antibiotics do more than inhibit their primary targets, describe how downstream processes critically participate in active death processes, and highlight insights gained from manipulating extracellular conditions.

* Moreover, understanding the differences in microbial physiology between host metabolic environments and the nutrient rich conditions commonly used to study bacterial pathogens will be important for translating in vitro discoveries into clinical care. --- **In other words, we need to learn to predict antibiotic resistance based on labels that are closer to what goes on in the host's body. The environment differs considerably and this could affect the efficacy of antibiotics.**

* Antibiotic lethality is increasingly understood to be driven by active death processes resulting from both target inhibition and subsequent induction of stress responses.

* Integration of these tools will enable identification of additional mechanistic details between primary target inhibition and subsequent lethality. -- This makes me think of Brendon Frey's idea of modelling the cell's behavior in response to a stimulus.

Bottom-line:
  * In many cases, the antibiotic binding its target is not the cause of bacterial death. Inhibiting the target often creates a cascade of downstream events that eventually result in cell-death.
  * Many of the downstream processes can be influenced by external (environmental) factors, but this is currently barely understood.
  * If we want data-driven discoveries to be better translatable to true clinical settings, we need data that is closer to the host.
