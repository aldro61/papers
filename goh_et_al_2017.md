# Deep learning for computational chemistry

* A really up to date review about deep learning methods for computational chemistry. 

* Mentions a lot of interesting papers, which I have highlighted in blue in the references.

* Key take home messages:
  * Using expert-designed molecular descriptors is kind of old school
  * Recent DL papers have shown that you could achieve similar or better results using molecular fingerprints
  * A lot of mention of multi-task learning and how it is important to deal with molecules for which we have little information
