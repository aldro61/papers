* **Inspiration:** how a reader skims through a document and only reads important parts in details to answer a question.

* **Overview:** The idea is to identify relevant pieces of a document using a coarse representation and then to detect detailed patterns using a fine representation.

* The selection of relevant pieces of text is treated as a latent variable, so it must be learned.

* The method jointly optmizes sentence selection and answer generation

* **Sentence selection:** p(s | x, d), where x is a question and d is a document. This is given by an attention model. In the attention model, they use the concatenated representations of a sentence and the query and then apply transformation ending with a softmax to get the probability.

* **Hard attention:** given p(s | x, d), create a document summary by sampling one or many sentences without replacement according to the probability distribution and concatenating their representation.

* **Soft attention:** the document summary is an average of all the sentence representations, weighted according to p(s | x, d).

* **Answer generation:** p(y | x, ^d), where ^d is the learned document summary.

* The authors try both hard attention and soft attention. Hard attention must be trained using reinforcement learning (algo: REINFORCE), while soft attention can be trained end-to-end using gradients. They also use something distant supervision, where they produce labels for each sentence (1 if it contains the answer and 0 otherwise). They use something called curriculum learning where they start with distant supervision and transition to REINFORCE.

* When learning to predict antibiotic resistance, we could generate labels for distant supervision based on the presence/absence of resistance genes in genome chunks.

* **Conclusions**: hard attention seems to produce better results than soft attention, but it takes longer to run. The bag-of-words and chunked-bag-of-words representation are decent coarse representations.
