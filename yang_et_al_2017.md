Antibiotic efficacy -- context matters

* The primary targets and mechanisms of action for most bactericidal antibiotics have been identified and well-studied [1]; however, there is a growing appreciation that antibiotic lethality is a complex systems-level process that is sensitive to environmental factors.

* In light of the diminishing pipeline for antibiotic discovery [3], there is an urgent need to better understand mechanisms and factors that influence antibiotic efficacy.

* We discuss how antibiotics do more than inhibit their primary targets, describe how downstream processes critically participate in active death processes, and highlight insights gained from manipulating extracellular conditions.

Bottom-line:
  * In many cases, the antibiotic binding its target is not the cause of bacterial death. Inhibiting the target often creates a cascade of downstream events that eventually result in cell-death.
  * Many of the downstream processes can be influenced by external (environmental) factors, but this is currently barely understood.
